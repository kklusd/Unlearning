# The PKU-AIR300 Dataset
The PKU-AIR300 Dataset is a new large-scale challenging aircraft dataset. It contains 320,000 annotated color images from 300 different classes in total. Each category contains 100 images at least, and a maximum of 10,000 images, which leads to the long tail distribution. According to the number of images in each category, it is divided all classes into two parts with 180 known classes for training and 120 novel unknown classes for testing respectively.
